# AutoXGB for Credit Card Fraud Detection

Link to full writeup on Medium: 

## Motivation
- XGBoost has established itself as one of the most important machine learning algorithms, given its versatility and impressive performance. 
- Having used XGBoost for previous projects, I am always open to making its implementation faster, better, and cheaper. 
- My curiosity was piqued when I came across (AutoXGB)[https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/autoxgb], which claims to be a 'no-brainer' library for simplifying the training and deployment of XGBoost. 
- Given my work in the financial services sector, where fraud is a significant concern, it would be an excellent opportunity to use credit card fraud data to assess how AutoXGB fares against the standard XGBoost setup usually used.
